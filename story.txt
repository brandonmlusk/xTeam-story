It was a dark and stormy night. Brandon was creating his awesonme program using github
He was working very quickly and was taking the first steps towards collaborative programming.
He was working from his apartment and the power did go out, but not to fear he had a backup of his work so he was quickly able to continue.

However there was an evil collaborator named Mason who decided that he was going to mess with Brandon. Mason was able to change
all of his files and in the end Brandon had no backups to his work. Everything was lost and Brandon was very sad. He sat in the 
shower and cried because he tried so hard on that code. Then a hero came in, another teammate who had a working copy of Brandon's code!

Version control to the rescue! Brandon put out a distress call to his valiant X-Team. Collin heard his plea for help and rushed to his
laptop to restore Brandon's file. A few git pulls and a few git pushes later and all of Brandon's files were saved. Now, to just deal
with that evil collaborator Mason...

Brandon got together the with Collin and Richard as they planned out their revenge for Mason.
The three removed Mason as a collaborator and because of that, Mason couldn't continue with the team for the group project.
Three days later, when Mason realized that he has been kicked off of his X-Team,
it was too late as the big project has been submitted and Mason was left with a 0. 
From this, Mason's never messed with anyone on github ever again.

Brandon was relieved to have version control save the day! He was able to have his xTeam help him out in a pinch.
The project Brandon was working ended being a critical simulation that helped develop the cure to corona virus. Because of this,
classes were able to resume normally, and the entire world was cured of this disease. Mason was put on trial for crimes against 
humanity and was never heard of again.
