It was a dark and stormy and Brandon was creating his awesonme program using github
He was working very quickly and was taking the first steps towards to collaborative programming.
He was working from his apartment and the power did go out, but not to fear he had a backup so he was quickly able to restore his work.

However there was an evil collaborator named Mason who decided that he was going to mess with Brandon. Mason was able to change
all of his files and in the end Brandon had no backups to his work. Everything was lost and Brandon was very sad. He sat in the 
shower and cried because he tried so hard on that code. Then a hero came in, another teammate who had a working copy of Brandon's code!

Version control to the rescue! Brandon put out a distress call to his valiant X-Team. Collin heard his plea for help and rushed to his
laptop to restore Brandon's file. A few git pulls and a few git pushes later and all of Brandon's files were saved. Now, to just deal
with that evil collaborator Mason...
